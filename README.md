# EuclideanSpace_swift

This repository consists of a Swift package
that contains abstractions for 2D/3D points and vectors.

It is intended to be used for game development in Swift.
(e.g. Pong, BrickBreaker, anything requiring a position/trajectory)


## Please note

This repository has been tested on macOS 11.0.1, 
running Xcode 12.2. The source was written in Swift 5.

You may use this repository for your own Swift projects --
be sure to keep your local copy up to date, 
as this codebase is a work in progress.

For now, 
please read this link on how to create/add a Swift framework 
to your Xcode project.

## Purpose

This repository will be a submodule of another project to come;
I am working on my own version of a BrickBreaker game.

It has always been my goal to develop for the Apple ecosystem,
but I need to further my understanding of the Swift programming language.
